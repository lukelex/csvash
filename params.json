It handles your CSV extraction by mapping the document headers with your model properties and automagically creating new filled instances.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nAdd this line to your application's Gemfile:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ngem 'csvash'\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then execute:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ bundle\r\n```\r\n\r\nNot using Rails? install it yourself with:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ gem install csvash\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nFirst of all you have to require it in your file:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nrequire 'csvash'\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn order to import from a CSV file you can pass the path where the file is allocated and a class:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nCsvash.modelify_and_import '/path/of/your/file.csv', User\r\n```\r\n\r\n_Where **collection** is an array of User objects, for example_\r\n\r\nHowever, to export you can pass the desired path and CSV filename. Finally, you can pass a collection of already filled objects from a specific class:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nCsvash.modelify_and_export '/path/to/file.csv', collection\r\n```\r\n\r\n_* The path and its directories are created automatically_\r\n\r\nTo get just a collection of hashes containing the csv data you can call:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nCsvash.hashify '/path/of/your/file.csv'\r\n```\r\n\r\n##Options\r\n\r\nThere are some behavior options that can be changed with its initializer. To create it just type:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ rails generate initializer csvash\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese are the avaiable options\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# If set to true it will only retain fields that matches the class to be filled. Default is false.\r\n# config.mass_assignment_safe = true\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n1. Fork it\r\n2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)\r\n3.
